<br>
<a href="https://njpietrow.github.io/Filter.io/">Filterio</a> is a photobooth appliction that uses facial recognition to overlay face filters onto a webcam video feed. By tracking specific facial features like eyes and a nose, Filterio can map filters onto a face by rotating and translating the filters accordingly. The design of the page takes influences from 80's synthwave styles. After exploring the available filter options, snap a picture with the capture button to save a photo and share with your friends!

## Technologies Used
This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

* The Canvas API to render the face filters as pngs
* Webpack and Babel to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code
* npm to manage project dependencies
* Media Pipe face mesh library to bring computer vision algorithms to the browser for facial recognition and facial landmark mapping

## Functionality & MVPs
With this application, users will be able to:
* View a live video feed on the webpage sourced to their webcam
* View video filters that have been mapped onto their face in the video feed
* See filters respond to movement as their face rotates, tilts, and translates across the screen
* Select from multiple options of video filters
* Take pictures using the webcam, photbooth style.
* Start and stop the live video feed

In addition, the project will include:
* Links to the creator's personal pages
* An introductory instruction popup
* A descriptive readme and licenses/credits

## Upcoming Features
