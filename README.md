Filterio uses facial recognition to overlay images and filters onto a video feed from a webcam. By tracking specific facial features like eyes and a nose, Filterio can map images onto a face. When you find a filter you like, snap a picture with the capture button to share the photo with your friends!

## Technologies Used
This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

* The Canvas API to render the face filters as pngs
* Webpack and Babel to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code
* npm to manage project dependencies
* Media Pipe face mesh library to bring computer vision algorithms to the browser for facial recognition and facial landmark mapping

## Functionality & MVPs
With this application, users will be able to:
* View a live video feed on the webpage sourced to their webcam
* View video filters that have been mapped onto their face in the video feed
* See filters respond to movement as their face rotates, tilts, and translates across the screen
* Select from multiple options of video filters
* Take pictures using the webcam, photbooth style.
* Start and stop the live video feed

In addition, the project will include:
* Links to the creator's personal pages
* An introductory instruction popup
* A descriptive readme and licenses/credits

## Upcoming Features
* option for camera shutter sound effect
* flappy bird mini game controlled by position of nose
* mobile device responsiveness
