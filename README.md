# Filterio
Filterio uses facial recognition to apply live video filters. By tracking  specific facial features, Filterio can overlay images and content onto your live webcam video feed and display them on the screen.


## Functionality & MVPs
With this application, users will be able to:
* View a live video feed on the webpage sourced to their webcam
* View video filters that have been mapped onto their face in the video feed
* See filters respond to movement as their face rotates, tilts, and translates across the screen
* Select from multiple options of video filters

## Implementation Timeline
* Thursday - research the tracking js libary and learn how to use/import
* Friday - Setup project, including getting webpack up and running. Design structure of page
* Saturday/Sunday - Display Live camera feed and display face recognition and landmarks
* Monday - Create face filters to map to user face
* Tuesday - Warp/skew filters based on face angle. Tune refresh rate
* Wednesday - Allow users to select filters and revamp page UI. 
* Thursday Morning - Deploy to GitHub pages. If time, rewrite this proposal as a production README.
